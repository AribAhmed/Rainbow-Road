# Rainbow-Road
A Mario Kart level made with Verilog only 

This project was made for an FPGA micrchip connecting to a VGA monitor. This microchip runs verilog code and displays and output through VGA. This microchip is used as a controller.
The name of the game is basically a racecar that is on a randomly generating road that keeps generating infinitely. The longer you stay alive, the more points you receive. This
project might seem simple but verilog is a language that only uses logic gates (AND, OR, NOR, NAND, XOR) to code. Its a very low level language that made this a challenging
project.
